        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These spicy roasted potatoes made with chili powder and other <br>seasonings 
            are a slight variation to standard home fries. <br>I make these spicy spuds 
            for breakfast every Sunday, <br>and my family loves them!</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 medium red potatoes, diced with peel</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chili powder</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C). <br>
                Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p></li>
            <li><p>Evenly distribute potatoes and onions in the prepared <br>
                baking dish. Season with garlic powder, kosher salt, <br>
                and chili powder. Drizzle with olive oil and stir <br>
                until well coated.</p></li>
            <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 10 minutes, <br>
                until potatoes are fork-tender and slightly crispy, <br>
                35 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately <br>
                sprinkle Cheddar cheese over top. Let sit until cheese melts, <br>
                about 5 minutes.</p></li>
        </ol>
